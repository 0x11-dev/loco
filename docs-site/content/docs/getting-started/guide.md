## Guide Assumptions

Loco is a Rust API and web framework for full stack product builders.

You need to be familiar with Rust to a moderate level. You need to know how to build, test, and run Rust projects, have used some popular libraries such as `clap`, `regex`, `tokio`, `axum` or other web framework, nothing too fancy. There are no crazy lifetime twisters or complex / too magical, macros in Loco that you need to know how they work.

Loco is strongly inspired by Rails. If you know Rails _and_ Rust, you'll feel at home. If you only know Rails and new to Rust, you'll find Loco refreshing. We do not assume you know Rails.

_Rails is so great, that this guide is strongly inspired from the [Rails guide, too](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)_
